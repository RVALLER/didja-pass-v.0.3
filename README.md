# didja-pass-v.0.3
Just a fun final grade calculator I made because I knew I had classes in the bag this semester.
This project takes the aspect of weighted average and calculates (in this case my) rough estimated grade based on class parameters and their respective weights
It then outputs it into a very mediocre tkinter gui for a simple but effective display. Feel free to edit parameters and weights to fit your own personal needs!
